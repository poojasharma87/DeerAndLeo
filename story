One day a leopard saw a gorgeous deer grazing within the sun.
 The leopard was hungry and wanted to hunt the deer for a meal.
 "That deer looks delicious.
  I will be able to quietly go near it and attack! 
  The deer wouldn't even know what struck it," the leopard thought.

On the opposite side, the deer was chewing on fresh, green grass.
 "This grass is so sweet. I should be coming here every day. 
 The flowers have such sweet nectar, the grass is so supple" thought the deer.
